# ‚õìÔ∏è EduCertify: Blockchain Document Verifier

EduCertify is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows for the secure storage and verification of document hashes on the blockchain. It provides a simple and modern interface for an administrator to upload a document's hash associated with a student's address and for anyone to verify that document's authenticity later.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Hash Storage**: An admin can upload a document's SHA-256 hash to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain.
- **Immutable Verification**: Anyone can upload a document to verify if its hash matches a record on the blockchain.
- **Admin-Only Uploads**: The smart contract restricts the upload functionality to the contract administrator (`admin`).
- **Modern UI**: Features a sleek, responsive "glass effect" user interface.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Connects with MetaMask for easy interaction with the blockchain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Smart Contract**: Solidity
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Web3 Library**: Web3.js
- **Hashing**: Web Crypto API (SHA-256)

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension installed on your browser.
- A code editor (like VS Code).
- Ganache

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/UNKNOWN69x0/EduCertify.git
    ```

2.  **Deploy the Smart Contract:**
    - Open `DocumentVerification.sol` in an online IDE like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
    - Compile and deploy the contract to a test network (e.g., Localhost connected with ganache).
    - Copy the deployed contract's address.

3.  **Configure the Frontend:**
    - Open `app.js` in your code editor.
    - Replace the placeholder `contractAddress` with the address you copied from Remix.
    ```javascript
    const contractAddress = "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS";
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    - Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser or use live server extension if on VS Code. The page will prompt you to connect your MetaMask wallet.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### Storing a Document Hash

1.  The contract `admin` connects their wallet.
2.  They select a document and enter a student's Ethereum address in the "Store Document Hash" card.
3.  The frontend calculates the document's SHA-256 hash.
4.  The admin clicks "Upload to Blockchain," which calls the `uploadDocument` function in the smart contract, storing the hash.

### Verifying a Document

1.  Anyone can open the DApp.
2.  They select the document they want to verify and enter the associated student's address in the "Verify Document" card.
3.  The frontend calculates the hash of the selected document.
4.  The user clicks "Verify Against Blockchain," which calls the `verifyDocument` view function to check if the hash exists on-chain for that student. The result is then displayed.
